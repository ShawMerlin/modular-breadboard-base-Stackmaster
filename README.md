# Modular Breadboard
This is the main repository for the modular breadboard project and it also contains the 3D files for all available breadboard bases.

I decided to start this project because I wasn't happy with the quality of existing breadboard/banana-jack combinations and it kinda escalated from there.   

# Modules
## Banana Bread

* Simple banana jack to female header adapter module 
* Handles up to 24A in and 3A per pin out 
* Supports both 'normal' banana jacks as well as the 'safety' type with an isolation sleeve
* For more info, click [here](https://github.com/testudor/banana-bread)

* Switchable logic levels via jumper
* Provides up to 3A@5v and 600mA@3<area>.3V

# Bases
## 1660-1

![1660 tie-point breadboard base](./images/base%201660-1%20cnc%20small.png)

This base is meant for 1x1660/2x830 tie-point breadboards and the only one currently available
